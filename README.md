This repository contains my continuous assessment (CA) assignment for the Software Engineering 2 module, completed during my second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

# Project Overview

In this assignment, I extended and tested a comprehensive USE model for a library management system. I chose this topic due to my strong interest in library systems and my hands-on experience with related code in USE during previous lab sessions.

The project involved exploring additional use case scenarios and developing a variety of UML diagrams to represent the system's components and their interactions clearly. I also focused on testing constraints with objects and implemented **SOIL** (Specification Object Interface Language) to ensure thorough testing of the model, enhancing its overall robustness and reliability.

### Key Features

- **Extended USE Model:** Developed an in-depth model for a library management system, incorporating various components.
- **UML Diagrams:** Created several UML diagrams to visualize system architecture and interactions.
- **Constraint Testing:** Tested constraints on objects to validate system behavior and integrity.
- **SOIL Implementation:** Utilized SOIL for efficient and effective testing of the model.
