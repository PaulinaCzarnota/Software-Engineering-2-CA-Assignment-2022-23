This is my CA assignment for the Software Engineering 2 module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. 

The assignment involves extending and testing a more comprehensive USE model for the Library system. 

This assignment was chosen due to its alignment with my interests and prior experience working on Library code in USE during labs. It presents an exciting challenge by exploring extra use case scenarios and creating various types of diagrams to visualize the system's components and interactions. Additionally, it involves testing constraints with objects and using SOIL implementations for easier testing.
