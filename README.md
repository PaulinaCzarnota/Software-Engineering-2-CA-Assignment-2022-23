This is my continuous assessment (CA) assignment for the Software Engineering 2 module in the second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

In this assignment, I extended and tested a detailed USE model for a Library system. I selected this topic due to my keen interest in library management systems and my previous hands-on experience with related code in USE during lab sessions.

The project posed an exciting challenge, allowing me to explore additional use case scenarios and develop various UML diagrams to illustrate the system's components and their interactions. Additionally, I tested constraints with objects and implemented SOIL for efficient testing, enhancing the overall robustness of the model.
